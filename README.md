# React Stopwatch â€” Responsive Timer with Vite & Tailwind CSS

A simple and responsive Stopwatch built with React and Vite. Use it to track tasks, practice sessions, workouts, or any timed activity in the browser. The UI adapts to phones and desktops. The code shows React hooks, Tailwind CSS, and small, well-scoped components.

Features ðŸš€
- Start, stop, reset, and lap functions.
- Millisecond-level timing with clean formatting.
- Persist laps and last state in localStorage.
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS.
- Small, focused React hooks for timing logic.
- Vite for fast dev server and builds.
- No external timer libraries; all logic in plain React.

Demo
- Live demo: open the deployed app or run locally.
- Screenshot above shows the core UI: time display, controls, and lap list.

Installation (dev)
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Start the dev server.

Commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XXSKYANXX/react-stopwatch.git
cd react-stopwatch
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run locally
- Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
- Use the Start, Stop, and Reset controls.
- Use Lap to capture split times.

Build for production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Build outputs live static files in the `dist` folder. Serve them with any static host or push to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

Usage
- Start: begins time from zero or current time.
- Stop: pauses the timer.
- Reset: clears time and laps.
- Lap: saves a timestamp relative to the running timer.
- Export: copy lap list as CSV or JSON for simple tracking.

Example usage notes
- The app saves state in `localStorage`. If you close the tab and return, the stopwatch resumes from the saved state.
- Laps show duration and running total. Tap any lap to mark it or copy it.

Customization
- Colors and spacing live in Tailwind config. Change `tailwind.config.js` to update theme colors.
- Timing precision: modify the hook to use 10 ms or 1 ms depending on needs.
- Add a sound on lap by importing a short audio file and calling `audio.play()` inside the lap handler.
- Add keyboard shortcuts: wire `keydown` events to start/stop and lap functions.

Styling
- Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for layout.
- The layout uses CSS Grid for the full layout and Flex for control bar.
- Themes: create dark and light themes by toggling a root class and by using Tailwind variables.

Project structure
- src/
  - App.jsx â€” root app and layout
  - components/
    - StopwatchDisplay.jsx â€” shows formatted time
    - Controls.jsx â€” start/stop/reset/lap buttons
    - LapList.jsx â€” lap items and export controls
  - hooks/
    - useStopwatch.js â€” core timing hook (start, stop, reset, lap)
  - styles/
    - index.css â€” Tailwind imports and small utilities
  - main.jsx â€” Vite entry
- public/ â€” static assets and favicon
- dist/ â€” build output after `npm run build`

Core hook (design summary)
- useStopwatch exposes: time, running, start(), stop(), reset(), lap(), laps[].
- It uses `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval` depending on needed precision.
- It stores timestamps and computes elapsed time on each frame.
- It saves state to `localStorage` on each change.

Accessibility & responsiveness
- Button targets meet minimum touch sizes.
- Buttons work with keyboard: Enter and Space trigger actions.
- Labels use aria attributes for screen readers.
- Colors meet contrast ratios for readability.
- Layout uses breakpoints that fit mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Testing
- Unit test the hook logic with Jest.
- Mock timers with `jest.useFakeTimers()` and advance timers.
- Test UI with React Testing Library:
  - Render the component.
  - Simulate start/stop and assert time updates.
  - Assert lap creation and storage.

Contributing
- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests.
- Fork the repo and make a branch per change.
- Run tests locally before PR.
- Keep commits small and clear.

Releases
- Download the release file and execute it from the releases page: https://github.com/XXSKYANXX/react-stopwatch/releases
  - The releases page contains compiled builds and release notes.
  - Download the release archive (for example `react-stopwatch-v1.2.0.zip`) and run the included start script or serve the static files.
- You can also use the badge at the top to jump to the release page:

Releases notes checklist
- Each release will include:
  - A zip or tarball with compiled `dist` files.
  - A checksummed archive or signed asset for integrity.
  - A short changelog entry per release tag.

Deploy
- Deploy static `dist` to GitHub Pages
  - Use `gh-pages` or Vite deploy scripts to push `dist` branch.
- Deploy to Netlify or Vercel by connecting the repo and setting the build command to `npm run build` and publish directory to `dist`.

CI / CD
- Use GitHub Actions for build and lint checks.
- Example pipeline:
  - Install Node
  - Install dependencies
  - Run `npm run build`
  - Run tests
  - Create release artifacts on tagged commits

Common commands
```bash
npm run dev     # start dev server
npm run build   # build for production
npm run preview # preview build locally
npm test        # run tests
npm run lint    # lint codebase
```

Troubleshooting
- If the dev server fails, remove `node_modules` and reinstall.
- If the timer drifts on low-power devices, prefer `requestAnimationFrame` over `setInterval`.
- If localStorage restores an old state, clear storage with browser dev tools.

Preview images & resources
- Use high-quality screenshots for the README and release listing.
- Use simple SVG icons for controls to keep size small.
